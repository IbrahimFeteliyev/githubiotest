          You have bewitched me body and soul. And I love … I love … I love you.
          I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.
        </p>
        <p class="b">
          And if love is just a collection of stolen moments, then I want to
          steal as many as I can with you. Maybe love isn’t about forever. Maybe
          it’s about feeling something so deeply, even for a little while, that
          it changes you. And you’ve changed me.
        </p>
        <p class="c">
          You must know... Surely you must know it was all for you. You are too
          generous to trifle with me. My affections and feelings have not
          changed, but one word from you will silence me forever.
